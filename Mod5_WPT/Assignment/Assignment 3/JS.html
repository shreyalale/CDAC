        It is rightly said that being disciplined is essential in life. When a person leads a 
        disciplined life, they set an easy path to success. They will develop an approach to 
        happiness and a beautiful future ahead. Being disciplined is the practice of having
        a scheduled daily routine which helps an individual to be punctual and hard-working. 
        An individual is taught what being disciplined means from the time they are young. 
        Even though discipline takes a lot of effort, the advantages of a disciplined life 
        make it a worthwhile endeavour.
